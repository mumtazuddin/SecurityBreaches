# SecurityBreaches

I was searching the web for data sets and landed on this site which had projects from github and it tells exactly how many number of rows and columns are there in the dataset and they i picked up the data set called cyber security breaches.

I saw kaggle.com, healthdatagov.com but they were all either worked on or had data cleaning done already. 

I choosed this one because it does need cleaning and by far nobody has worked on this data making it unique for me to work upon and it was free to download at this url-

here is the link for the particular data set i picked up from the site above.-

Explaining the data pretty much i have checked for security breaches in a major project in my undergrad thats why i was interested for this particular data set because I have worked on it before in a different programming language. 


So to be exact the data set has about 14columns, 1056rows, and about 300kb for the excel file

Data is free of cost.
Data is legal.


#### Hypothesis I- 
Do you have any expectation about the number of events reported for each year? Is the trend upwards or downwards?

 -**YES, proved in the project and the trend was upwards and then a steep fall.** 
 
#### Hypothesis II-
Do you have any expectation about the state in which breaches occurred? Which states are the largest and therefore might have the most breaches?

- **YES, proved in the project and the largest state has the maximum breaches and the smallest state has the least amount of breaches.** it is explained well inside
