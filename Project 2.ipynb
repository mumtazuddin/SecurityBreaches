    "Well this countplot shows the trend in the different states on breaches over the time which i have arranged in a descending order of the highest to lowest so we can see that the most breaches are in **state of california** which is a fairly bigger state than others hence more breaches in that state and then the trend follows to the second biggest state area wise which is **state of texas** and then you can easily see in the plot that the last in the place is a fairly small **state of vermont** and hence very less breaches there less than 5. \n",

    "I did understand the trend and over the course of this project i learned that the years with most breaches were **2010-13** and then i guess that there must be security measures intorduced thoroughly for data prevention and that is why breaches dropped significantly from **2014**"
